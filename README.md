I'm João, a student from Brazil. Nice to meet you!

I love learning and exploring everything about computer science, programming, design, development and more. I'm also looking forward to becoming a nicer human in this big blue ball floating somewhere. I really enjoy building stuff most of the time, from simple school assignments to complex pieces of software. Oh, I was also an WWDC Scholar in [2020](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2020) and [2021](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2021). 🏅

Currently, I am a CS student at the [Federal Institute of Santa Catarina](https://www.ifsc.edu.br), in Brazil, a project intern @ [Cindori](https://cindori.org) and a fantastic older brother.

If you want to chat or have a pleasing small talk, feel free to reach me on my social links or send me an e-mail (you can find more info on the side panel). 📪
