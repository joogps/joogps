I'm JoÃ£o. Thank you so much for coming around!

I enjoy a whole lot of stuff â€“ including but not limited to computer science, programming, design, math and development â€“ also I'm always looking forward to becoming a nicer human in this floating blue sphere. Coolest thing to ever happen to me? Probably having been an ï£¿ WWDC Scholar in [2020](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2020) and [2021](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2021).

I am currently a high school senior also doing an IT course at the [Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFSC)](https://www.ifsc.edu.br). I'm a team member @ [Cindori](https://cindori.org), and I also develop [my own apps](http://twitter.com/MagicDrawApp) and libraries and designs and other cool shit you might find.

You can learn more about my work over at [joogps.codes](https://joogps.codes). You can find my Twitter and Instagram right below the title of this document if, perhaps, you want a friend as well.
