I'm JoÃ£o. Thanks for coming around!

I like computer science, programming, design, math and developing new products â€“ I'm also always looking forward to becoming a nicer human in this floating blue sphere. Coolest thing to ever happen? Probably having been an Apple WWDC Scholar in [2020](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2020) and [2021](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2021).

I am currently a high school senior also doing an IT course at the [Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFSC)](https://www.ifsc.edu.br). I'm a team member a [Cindori](https://cindori.org), and I also develop [my own apps](http://twitter.com/MagicDrawApp) and libraries and designs and other cool stuff you might find.

You can learn more about my work over at [joogps.com](https://joogps.com). You can also find me on Twitter and Instagram if, perhaps, you want a friend as well.
