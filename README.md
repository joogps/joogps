I'm João, a student from Brazil. Nice meeting you!

I love learning and exploring everything about but not limited to computer science, programming, design and development – always looking forward to becoming a nicer human in this big, floating blue sphere. 🌍
- I _really_ enjoy building all sorts of things.
- **Cool achievement:** I was an WWDC Scholar in [2020](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2020) and [2021](https://github.com/joogps/WWDC-2021).

Currently, I am coursing high school, as well as an integrated CS course at the [Federal Institute of Santa Catarina](https://www.ifsc.edu.br), in Brazil. I'm a project intern @ [Cindori](https://cindori.org), and I also develop my own apps. I'm a fantastic older brother too! You can learn more about my work over at [joogps.codes](https://joogps.codes).

If you want to chat, feel free to reach me on my social links or send me an e-mail (you can find more info on the side panel). 📪
